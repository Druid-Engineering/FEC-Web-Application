1) Roles & Responsibilities: Respect all opinions and try to come to a unanimous agreement for each direction we want to take. Grant will be project manager. Benjue is our team goal tracker and head of motivation. Inny is head of design/creative director.

2) Communication: Morning stand up meeting/end of day check in. Slack as conversation tool for time outside of meetings. During coding periods we will be in zoom with mic/camera off. If anyone needs anything they can jump off mute and will have the team assist them.

4) Conflict Handling:
  - Acknowledge that everyone has different opinions.
  - Understand that any point of conflict isn't personal.
  - Meet as a group and let each member talk about their side of the story.
